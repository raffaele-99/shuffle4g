# Primary Goal

- This project should be a single-packaged executable that can be run on macOS/Windows/Linux (via PyInstaller) without requiring the user to install any dependencies.
    - The executable should be created via a GitHub workflow on tagged push events (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
    - The executable should be uploaded as a release asset.
